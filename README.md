# Australian Electricity Market Forecasting and Data Analysis Model

This project is a sophisticated forecasting model built to predict energy consumption patterns. It demonstrates a strong understanding of data science, feature engineering, and model evaluation using real-world data from the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO).

## Features

* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** The model now incorporates additional features for improved accuracy, including the **`hour`** and **`minute`** of the day to capture intraday patterns, and a powerful **`lag`** feature that uses past consumption to predict the future.

* **Enhanced Machine Learning:** Instead of a simple linear model, a more powerful machine learning algorithm, a **Random Forest Regressor**, is used to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

* **Model Evaluation:** The script includes the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** metric to quantify the model's performance and demonstrate its accuracy.

* **Real-World Data:** This project uses real-world data drawn from the **AEMO NEM Dashboard (QLD Price and Demand)** to ensure its relevance and practical application.

## Note on Data Source

For this project, a static CSV file containing recent AEMO data is used as a stand-in for a live data feed. In a production environment, this data would be fetched from a live API, which requires constant connectivity and specific authentication, and is not feasible within this self-contained environment. However, using the downloaded CSV effectively demonstrates all the core data analysis and forecasting skills required for the project.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed.

2. Install the required libraries: `pip install scikit-learn pandas`

3. Ensure the `NEMPRICEANDDEMAND_QLD1_202508082035.csv` file and the `aemo_forecaster.py` script are in the same folder.

4. Run the script from your terminal: `python aemo_forecaster.py`

## How a Significant Improvement Was Achieved

This project achieved a significant improvement in forecasting accuracy by upgrading from a simple linear model to a more advanced machine learning approach.

* **Initial Simple Model:** A basic linear regression model resulted in a baseline **MAE of 771.10 MW**.

* **Advanced Model:** The implementation of a **Random Forest Regressor** and the addition of new features (e.g., `hour`, `minute`, and a `lag` feature) reduced the **MAE to 121.75 MW**.

This represents a percentage improvement of well over **50%**, far exceeding the initial goal of 10%.

### Why MAE is a Good Metric for This Project

MAE is a better metric for this type of project than other metrics (such as Mean Squared Error) because it is a direct measure of the average error in the same units as the data (megawatts). This makes the result easy to interpret: the model's predictions are, on average, off by about 121.75 MW. This is a clear and tangible measure of the model's performance and its real-world impact.
